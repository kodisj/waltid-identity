# waltid-target-ios

This module contains iOS specific implementations, e.g., for the waltid-crypto-ios module.

You can find both Swift code implementation and the corresponding Kotlin bindings in here.

For compilation, you will require Xcode (as this is Swift code), which only works on macOS, and, please make sure `kdoctor` is not reporting any issues for your environment.
